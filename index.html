        <h3>Working with django and python in this tutorial makes some assumptions about pre-requisite comfort with the
            development of websites in general:

    <section class="main-section" id="install_dependencies">
        <header class="heading">Install Dependencies</header>
        <p>For django applications, you will need to install python and a tool that creates virtual environments called
            pipenv. Check your system to see which version of python you have available. You can also check for
            pipenv by using the following terminal commands: </p>
        <code> $ python3 --version </code>
        <br>
        <code> $ pipenv --version </code>

            <p>I recommend Python 3.7 or higher for best performance. If you need to install either program use
                Homebrew to install them globally with these commands: </p>
        <code> $ brew install python </code>
        <br>
        <code> $ brew install pipenv </code>
        <p> Now you need to create a directory for your project. My application is a simple 'todo' list that I am
            calling 'honeyDo-django'. Once you make this directory, you will need to cd into it for the next round
            of installations. </p>
        <code> $ mkdir honeyDo-django </code>
        <p> OR <br> You can create a corresponding GitHub repo, initialize it with a README.md, and clone
            into it for easy git connection to make the root directory. </p>
        <code> $ git clone &ltREPO URL> </code>
        <br>
        <code> $ cd honeyDo-django/ </code>
        <p> Now you are going to use pipenv to install locally inside your project. It is important NOT to install
            these dependencies globally! Also, unlike npm, you will need to type out 'install' as 'i' doesn't work.
            The first installation will be django itself. The second is a library that will connect django to
            postgreSQL which will be hosting the database information. </p>
        <code> $ pipenv install django </code>
        <br>
        <code> $ pipenv install psycopg2-binary </code>

    <section class="main-section" id="getting_started">
        <header class="heading">Getting Started</header>
        <p>Now when you open the project in a text editor, you will see two new files have been added: Pipfile and
            Pipfile.lock. These function as a holding place for all dependencies and works similarly to node_modules,
            but do not require gitignore. The next step is to start the project itself. Naming convention can make
            this a little confusing, so be sure to know which directory is the root of the project and which one is
            the application itself. </p>
        <code> $ pipenv run django-admin startproject honeyDo_django . </code>
        <p> A few things to notice. First, you can substitute any name for your project after the startproject
            command, but best practice is to use snake_case for python/django. Second, the . at the end of the
            command is important so you don't create a sub-folder within the project. Finally, when you return to
            your text editor, you will see several new files have been created automatically. Now it is time to enter
            the virtual environment inside the project. Use this command to enter: </p>
            <code> $ pipenv shell </code>
            <p> You should notice a change in your bash command. Depending on the individual set up, it may
                explicitly say 'virtual env' or 'env' OR it may put your project name in front of the $. If this
                command doesn't work, you can also try: </p>
        <code> $ source .env/bin/activate </code>
        <p> Once inside the virtual environment, you need to create the application files. This time you will not
            need the . at the end.</p>
        <code> $ django-admin startapp honeyDo_app </code>
        <p> If django-admin doesn't work for some reason, you can replace it with <code>python3 manage.py</code> as
            long as that file exists in the current directory.
        </p>

        <section class="main-section" id="database_setup">
            <header class="heading">Database Setup</header>
        <p> Now that all the django files are in place, it is time to switch gears and set up the database. For this
        project, you will use PostgreSQL, which is a more robust relational database than the default SQLite. If you
        need to install this locally, please follow <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/">this link</a> and
        select the appropriate version for your home machine. Once the application is installed and running, return to
            the terminal and open a new tab. You do not need to cd into the project to set up this database, but you
        will need to make note of the values entered since they will need to be inputted into the settings of your
            django project as well. First use this command to login to PostgreSQL:</p>
            <code> $ psql -d postgres </code>
            <p> You should enter into a new field within the terminal. The prompt may have '>' or 'postgres=#' to
                show access to the application. Now, create a database using the following commands: (Please note the uppercase may not be
                necessary on all operating systems.) PostgreSQL is case sensative and all database names MUST be
                lowercase. Also note the syntax with 'password' and ; at the end of the commands. You should get
                confirmation in the terminal after each command is executed. As always, you can change the values of
                the project to match your application and desired user name and password.
            </p>
            <code> CREATE DATABASE honeydo</code><br><code> CREATE USER honeyuser WITH PASSWORD 'honey'; </code>
            <br> <code> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE honeydo TO honeyuser </code> <br> <code> \q </code>
            <p> Now that the database is created, return to your text editor. Inside the project directory you need
                to find (around line 76) and enter the database information into the <code>settings.py</code> file as
                follows:
            </p>
<code> <pre>
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
         'NAME': 'honeydo',
         'USER': 'honeyuser',
         'PASSWORD': 'honey',
         'HOST': 'localhost',
    }
}
</pre>
</code>
            <p> You will also need to include the name of the application at the bottom of the INSTALLED_APPS list
                (around line 33). Please note this must match the name of the directory, NOT the database.</p>
            <code> <pre>
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'honeyDo_app',
]
            </pre></code>
            <p> Now, finally, you can run this terminal command and navigate to localhost:8000 to see a welcome
                Django app page!</p>
            <code> $ python3 manage.py runserver </code>
            <img src="./images/django-confirm.png" alt="confirmation page with django rocket"/>
