        <h3>Working with django and python in this tutorial makes some assumptions about pre-requisite comfort with the
            development of websites in general:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You know how to connect to files root directories and make new files within that structure</li>
            <li>You have a working knowledge of terminal commands</li>
            <li>You have a grasp of python syntax and some experience using the language</li>
            <li>You have some experience with backend views</li>
            <li>You are comfortable with basic CSS and HTML</li>
            <li>You can troubleshoot and debug if issues come up as you work through the tutorial steps</li>

        <p>For django applications, you will need to install python and a tool that creates virtual environments called
            pipenv. Check your system to see which version of python you have available. You can also check for
            pipenv by using the following terminal commands: </p>
        <code> $ python3 --version </code>
        <br>
        <code> $ pipenv --version </code>

            <p>I recommend Python 3.7 or higher for best performance. If you need to install either program use
                Homebrew to install them globally with these commands: </p>
        <code> $ brew install python </code>
        <br>
        <code> $ brew install pipenv </code>
        <p> Now you need to create a directory for your project. My application is a simple 'todo' list that I am
            calling 'honeyDo-django'. Once you make this directory, you will need to cd into it for the next round
            of installations. </p>
        <code> $ mkdir honeyDo-django </code>
        <p> OR <br> You can create a corresponding GitHub repo, initialize it with a README.md, and clone
            into it for easy git connection to make the root directory. </p>
        <code> $ git clone &ltREPO URL> </code>
        <br>
        <code> $ cd honeyDo-django/ </code>
        <p> Now you are going to use pipenv to install locally inside your project. It is important NOT to install
            these dependencies globally! Also, unlike npm, you will need to type out 'install' as 'i' doesn't work.
            The first installation will be django itself. The second is a library that will connect django to
            postgreSQL which will be hosting the database information. </p>
        <code> $ pipenv install django </code>
        <br>
        <code> $ pipenv install psycopg2-binary </code>

        <p>Now when you open the project in a text editor, you will see two new files have been added: Pipfile and
            Pipfile.lock. These function as a holding place for all dependencies and works similarly to node_modules,
            but do not require gitignore. The next step is to start the project itself. Naming convention can make
            this a little confusing, so be sure to know which directory is the root of the project and which one is
            the application itself. </p>
        <code> $ pipenv run django-admin startproject honeyDo_django . </code>
        <p> A few things to notice. First, you can substitute any name for your project after the startproject
            command, but best practice is to use snake_case for python/django. Second, the . at the end of the
            command is important so you don't create a sub-folder within the project. Finally, when you return to
            your text editor, you will see several new files have been created automatically. Now it is time to enter
            the virtual environment inside the project. Use this command to enter: </p>
            <code> $ pipenv shell </code>
            <p> You should notice a change in your bash command. Depending on the individual set up, it may
                explicitly say 'virtual env' or 'env' OR it may put your project name in front of the $. If this
                command doesn't work, you can also try: </p>
        <code> $ source .env/bin/activate </code>
        <p> Once inside the virtual environment, you need to create the application files. This time you will not
            need the . at the end.</p>
        <code> $ django-admin startapp honeyDo_app </code>
